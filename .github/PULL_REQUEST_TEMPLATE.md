Name both the PR and branch name as the Issue Number. 

*Ex:* 
PR Title: `Issue 48`
Branch Name: `issue_48`

**Changelog:**

*Summary of changes that have been made in a list format* 

*Ex:* 
1. [Changed...]
2. [Implemented...]

For commit messages, a general summary of changes made suffices. For the last commit message, use [this syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) to also close out the Issue when the PR is merged.

*Ex:* `Fixes #45`

Please add labels to the PR as well as assign people to review. In addition, post in the Slack channel *#pr-review* so that we know a PR needs review.
