[Provide a short description for the PR title and put in `()` which issue this PR corresponds to. Branch names should be short but meaningful; **always lowercase and hyphen-seperated**.]

**Changelog:** [*Summary of changes that have been made in a list format*]

- [Fill in]
- []

[For commit messages, a general summary of changes made suffices. For the last commit message, use [this syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) to also close out the Issue when the PR is merged.]

`Fixes #45` [Change this to whichever issue number the PR is for]

[Please add labels to the PR as well as assign people to review. In addition, post in the Slack channel *#pr-review* so that we know a PR needs review.]

[Lastly, remove all blocks of the text that are surrounded by `[]`, as they are just guidelines for the PR template and should not be a part of the actual PR.]
